      <p>
        Ronnie’s Café is a unique cafe that serves delicious comfort food at
        affordable prices. We are located at Singapore Polytechnic. We are one
        of those cafes that roast their own coffees. We roast the coffee in
        small batches, regularly in order to maintain the flavour and to meet
        the demand of the cafe and customers. Our coffee are roasted by under
        our specially trained staff.

        Our 60-seater cafe delivers the evergreen favourites classics like
        English Breakfast, Homemade Pancakes as well as weekend specials dishes
        like our Kaya Yogurt. You can always enjoy a slow and enchanted morning
        with friends or colleagues over gourmet coffees and luxurious teas.
